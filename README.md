Persistent Random Walk Cellular Model Comparison
==

The purpose of this project is to quantitatively compare different implementations of models of 
persistent cell motility, and different models of persistent cell motility. 

Repository organization
--

Organization of this repository is as follows:

* analyses/: routines to analyse standardized data. 
  * comparison/: routines to test for reproducibility, and to compare two samples of results for equality in distribution
  * derived/: routines to generate standardized derived data from standardized raw simulation outputs
* implementations/: framework implementations of repository schemas
* schemas/: specifications for models, simulations, and data formats targeting JSON format
